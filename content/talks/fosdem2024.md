In 2023, the NetBSD project celebrated 30 years since its first release, 0.8.
Now, four years after NetBSD 9, NetBSD 10 brings a huge number of changes and
improvements. This talk will dive into the most important new features of
NetBSD 10, such as performance and security improvements, expanded CPU and
GPU support, improved virtualization and more!

Another strength of NetBSD is its package system, pkgsrc, which is portable
to dozens of other OSes and can even be used like virtualenv for development
and deployment environments.

But over all this, the question remains: how relevant is NetBSD these days?
There is a small but friendly, and tight-knit community of users and
developers. The focus on portability and cleanliness provides a good system
for both beginners and tinkerers, but also a rock-solid server or workstation
system. We will go over some cool use cases and show ways that you can get
involved.
