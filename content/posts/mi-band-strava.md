I have used a Mi Band as a smartwatch / fitness tracking device for the last
couple years. Compared to, say, a Wear OS device, it offers a vastly better
deal:

 - It's cheap, at around 30-40 CHF.
 - The battery lasts several weeks.
 - It shows the time and tracks steps and movement.

The Wear OS device costs 5-10 times as much and needs daily charging. To be
fair, in addition to showing the time and tracking fitness data, it does many
other things that I don't need.

My old Mi Band would no longer hold a charge, so I upgraded to the Mi Band 6,
the latest iteration. I had read that it would be compatible with Strava,
which I like for tracking bike rides.
