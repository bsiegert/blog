I realized that this is the missing piece for supporting Go modules in pkgsrc.
If you go back and reread the "fetch" section in [Supporting Go Modules in
pkgsrc], it seems a bit awkward compared to a standard fetch action. The
reason is that `go mod download` re-packs the source into its own zip format
archive.

The module proxy (https://proxy.golang.org/) solves this problem and enables a
simple solution for modules, very similar to [lang/rust/cargo.mk]. Basically,
a target similar to `show-cargo-depends` that outputs a Makefile fragment
containing the names of modules that the current package depends upon. All
these become distfiles fetched from a hypothetical `$MASTER_SITES_GOPROXY`.
Crucially, this means that the distfiles do not have to be stored in a
`LOCAL_PORTS` subdirectory but can use the normal fetch infrastructure.

Now all that remains is implementing this :) There is some more time to do
that: Go 1.13 (to be released some time in summer) will use module support by
default. What's more, a bunch of new software (including the various
`golang.org/x/*` repositories) has `go.mod` files these days, using
module-based builds by default.
