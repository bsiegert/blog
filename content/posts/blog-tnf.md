So now I am even [posting over at
TNF](http://blog.NetBSD.org/tnf/entry/new_netbsd_flyers_available) on
<http://blog.NetBSD.org/>. Julian Fagir made new NetBSD flyers, and I committed
them to the TNF website.

I know that I should write more here but there is not much new on the
MirBSD front.

I updated the showcase to NetBSD-6_BETA on the Dom0, and now X refuses
to start. Oh well. X does start when using a GENERIC kernel. This is
very bad for showcase use, of course :(. pkgsrc is going into freeze
very soon, and I did not do a whole lot of MirBSD fixes this time
around. This is due to illness, searching for a new job, and working on
[the Go programming language](https://golang.org/), which is
expected to hit version 1.0 Real Soon Now(TM).

I brushed up my Algorithms and Data Structures a bit by reading the
third volume of TAOCP. Fantastic book.
